# main() has two meanings depending on the context
# - if this is the main.lrt file, then it refers to the program entrypoint
# - for modules, it acts as module init script & is ran as soon as the module is first loaded in any part of the program
#   note that the module state is **recreated** across parts of the application and state is not synced
# - This might change in the future
def main()

end

# Appending `pub` exports the functions to other modules
# It is not allowed in main.lrt file
def my_fn()
